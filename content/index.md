# What is a Species?
## Not a trivial question 
- Different species can look alike
- Members of the same species can look different
- Need to compare morphology, genetics, physiology and biochemistry

### Biological Species Concept
= Group of populations whose members have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable offspring
- All about reproductive isolation
- **Even if two individuals decide to mate, there are isolating mechanisms that prevent reproduction**
	- Even after fertilization there are even *more* barriers that can impact offspring survival and reproduction
		- Just Because an offspring survives, doesn't mean it is fertile and can reproduce
#### Gene flow connects populations of a species

## Some other species concepts
### Morphological Species Concept
- Distinguished by different structural features
### Ecological Species Concept
- Species defined by their ecological roles; occupy different niches but can interbreed
	- Disruptive selection plays a part
### Phylogenetic Species Concept
- Species are smallest distinguishable organs who's members descend from a common ancestor which possess combination of defining traits
	- Uses phylogenetic methods and usually DNA based
#### Species Concepts advantages and disadvantages
| Concept                       | Advantage                                                                                             | Disadvantage                                                                                                                                                          |

| Biological Species Concept    | Simple. Explicitly connected to gene flow                                                             | Doesn’t work for extinct or asexual organisms. Gene flow sometimes occurs.                                                                                            |
| Morphological Species concept | Simple. Requires the least amount of research. Works for all organisms                                | Subjective about what is similar/different How are distinctive features defined?                                                                                      |
| Ecological species concept    | Applicable to sexual & asexual organisms. Acknowledges the role of the environment/abiotic conditions | Can’t be used on extinct organisms. Can be subjective. Species could interbreed even with different ecological niches. Would create many more species (disadvantage?) |
| Phylogenetic species concept  | Based on evolutionary history. Integrates a lot of data. Provides likelihoods                         | Can be subjective. Requires a lot of information about related species. Requires computational power                                                                                                                                                                      |
## Speciation can happen in two ways
### Speciation - *the process of one species splitting into 2*
#### Allopatric speciation
- Gene pools diverge by mutation, natural selection and genetic drift
- Can be caused by: 
	- ##### Continental drift
		- Formerly **continuous** geographic ranges split, allowing the now **allopatric** populations to evolve independently in a new region
	- ##### Sea level rising
		- 1 big island -> 2 smaller islands with 2 allopatric populations
	- ##### Orogeny (mountain uplifting)
		- Range split by a mountain -> 2 allopatric populations
#### Sympatric speciation
- Not as common, but can happen if gene flow is reduced (habitat differentiation or sexual selection)
- Can be caused by:
	- ##### Polyploidy - more than one pair of chromosomes
	- ##### Exploiting new ecological resources not used by parent population
	- ##### Sexual selection- tend to mate based on coloration or other characteristics
