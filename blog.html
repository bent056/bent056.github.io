                                            <p>2023.10.11 - <em>Daniel</em></p>

                                        <p>The past 12 hours have been crazy; my body is so sore, and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to survive the day.
                                        I&#39;ve been working on this damn site since around 8pm last night, and I&#39;m just now getting the skeleton completed.
                                        I&#39;ve been trying to figure out a way to use .md files directly as site pages or whatever, since GitHub is supposed to have support for that.
                                        I&#39;m most likely doing something wrong though, as I can&#39;t seem to figure out a way to make it work. Oh well I&#39;ll get it figured out eventually.
                                        Another thing I really want to add is a comment section - a live one, so people can chat to each other or leave suggestions. 
                                        Surely everyone will remain civil and respectful of each other and us. 
                                        As far as actual detailing goes, we&#39;ve got 1-2 jobs today depending on if they decide to reschedule or not, but I know I&#39;m cooked regardless.
                                        Sho had the great idea to print out a physical checklist of which parts of the car we need to photograph, and turn it into an invoice of sorts.
                                        I know nobody cares to download it, but I think it would be cool to have them on the site just to give me something to do.
                                        Next week I&#39;ll be stopping by Koch Chemie again to pick up some more chemicals as we&#39;re running low, and I&#39;m excited to check out their new stuff.
                                        They dropped a bunch of new products for SEMA last week and they&#39;re looking pretty sick.
                                        They had a special limited edition Gentle Snow Foam X-Mas edition (<em>Gfx</em>), but it looks like it&#39;s sold out on the site.
                                        But Liam the <strong>goat</strong> said he might have some extras at the office, so if he can hook us up that would be super dope. 
                                        Enough writing for now though, I&#39;ve got to get back to work building this thing ugh.</p>

                                        </div>
                                        <p>My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. 
                                        This is my confession. If you&#39;re watching this tape, I&#39;m probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank 
                                        Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly 
                                        after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would
                                        then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always
                                        thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and 
                                        took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took
                                        me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was 
                                        weak. I didn&#39;t want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named
                                        Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my 
                                        family. I didn&#39;t know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. 
                                        Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a &quot;hit&quot; – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was 
                                        seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon 
                                        recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. 
                                        The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, 
                                        but I&#39;m a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of 
                                        the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had 
                                        no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself
                                        for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me 
                                        this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in &quot;Blood Money.&quot;] I can&#39;t take this anymore. I 
                                        live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make
                                        this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.</p>
