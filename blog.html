                                            <p>2023.13.12 - <em>Daniel</em></p>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>Finally got around to creating a pricing page to include all the services they offer. I created a quick access button on the homepage, but
                                        I feel like I should also create a button in the navbar so it&#39;s accessible from any page.  Still need to create the contact and review pages, but I want
                                        to take my time to make them look good and match the vibe of the rest of the site. 
                                        Currently need to:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Fix the gallery to show multiple rows of images without breaking the scrollbar</li>
                                        <li>Create contact and review pages, and make them fully functional</li>
                                        <li>Somehow make the site even more mobile friendly, maybe by making the container squeeze down to fit mobile screens?</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>November and December have been pretty good for us so far,  and we are so grateful to everyone who gave us the chance to clean their cars. For anyone
                                        who hasn&#39;t, be sure to take advantage of our extended sale, it ends on 31 January. Also wanted to mention that we can do more than just detailing - if you
                                        need any basic work done to your car, we can take care of that too! 
                                        If you need an oil change, we can do it for the cost of the oil and filter + $10.
                                        If you need a brake job, we can do it for the cost of the parts + $50 per axle.
                                        If you provide your own parts then that cost will be subtracted from the total, and if you are not sure what your car needs, we will always be very transparent
                                        with the price of anything we are purchasing for your car. 
                                        I also just wanted to remind everyone that we also offer paint corrections, which always include an interior vacuum and full exterior wash and decontamination. 
                                        Some exciting news - we are thinking of breaking into the ceramic coating market as well! Of course we will make sure to practice on our own vehicles until we
                                        are confidently proficient, but if anyone is thinking about getting a ceramic coating, we will be offering a significantly reduced rate for a limited time. </p>

                                            <p>2023.10.11 - <em>Daniel</em></p>

                                        <p>The past 12 hours have been crazy; my body is so sore, and I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to survive the day.
                                        I&#39;ve been working on this damn site since around 8pm last night, and I&#39;m just now getting the skeleton completed.
                                        I&#39;ve been trying to figure out a way to use .md files directly as site pages or whatever, since GitHub is supposed to have support for that.
                                        I&#39;m most likely doing something wrong though, as I can&#39;t seem to figure out a way to make it work. Oh well I&#39;ll get it figured out eventually.
                                        Another thing I really want to add is a comment section - a live one, so people can chat to each other or leave suggestions. 
                                        Surely everyone will remain civil and respectful of each other and us. 
                                        As far as actual detailing goes, we&#39;ve got 1-2 jobs today depending on if they decide to reschedule or not, but I know I&#39;m cooked regardless.
                                        Sho had the great idea to print out a physical checklist of which parts of the car we need to photograph, and turn it into an invoice of sorts.
                                        I know nobody cares to download it, but I think it would be cool to have them on the site just to give me something to do.
                                        Next week I&#39;ll be stopping by Koch Chemie again to pick up some more chemicals as we&#39;re running low, and I&#39;m excited to check out their new stuff.
                                        They dropped a bunch of new products for SEMA last week and they&#39;re looking pretty sick.
                                        They had a special limited edition Gentle Snow Foam X-Mas edition (<em>Gfx</em>), but it looks like it&#39;s sold out on the site.
                                        But Liam the <strong>goat</strong> said he might have some extras at the office, so if he can hook us up that would be super dope. 
                                        Enough writing for now though, I&#39;ve got to get back to work building this thing ugh.</p>
